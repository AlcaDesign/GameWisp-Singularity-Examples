# SocketIO-client-app Overview

## Example Description

This is a simple single page application that uses Socket.io-client in the browser to communicate with GameWisp's Singularity API. This is an extremely simplement implementation and is intended only to showcase the basics of interacting with the API using WebSockets, as opposed to being a full-fledged example. 

It is recommended to [review the documentation](https://gamewisp.readme.io/docs/quick-start) to get a better idea of how Singularity works.

For a server-side example, see SocketIO-server-app in the examples folder of this project. For a more robust example, check out the Twitch-bot example.

If you would like to include a working example of your own to this project, please submit a pull request. We're particularly interested in simple examples that leverage different programming languages and libraries than JavaScript and Socket.IO.
