# SocketIO-client-app Overview

## Example Description

This is a simple single page application that uses Socket.io-client and CryptoJS in the browser to communicate with GameWisp's Singularity API. 

It is recommend to review the Singularity API in the root of this project to understand how the API works. 

For a server-side example, see SocketIO-server-app in the examples folder of this project. For a more robust example, check out the Twitch-bot example.
